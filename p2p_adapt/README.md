P2P Crypto Adaptation - Starter Package
======================================

This directory was created automatically as a scaffold for converting the uploaded mini-app (from /mnt/data/treasure-hunt_dir) into a P2P crypto marketplace, preserving original design.

Paths:
- Original app extracted to: /mnt/data/treasure-hunt_dir
- This scaffold: /mnt/data/p2p_adapt

What I did now (automated):
- Unpacked your archive and inspected top-level files.
- Created this scaffold with a prioritized plan, simple backend/frontend skeleton templates, a minimal ERC20 escrow contract example, and checklists for security and deployment.

Detected manifests (top of files): README.md

Next recommended steps (automated & manual):
1. Review detected stack (see manifests and tree below). If the app uses Node/React/Python â€” I'll adapt the skeleton to match.
2. Run tests and start the dev server locally to identify runtime specifics.
3. Integrate the escrow flow using the provided smart-contract example, or configure custodial wallet flow for BTC.
4. Add KYC/2FA options and admin dispute UI using templates in this scaffold.
5. Perform security hardening, audits, and pen-tests before any production funds are used.

Important: I prepared templates, but they are NOT integrated into your original code automatically yet. I will adapt files into your repo when you confirm which stack to use or I will attempt an automatic adaptation on next iteration.
